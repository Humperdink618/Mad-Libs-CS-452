Bats Are So Cool!
---------------
Bats are so cool! They are blue, hairy animals which have wings. They like to 
 fly around at 6:00 which makes some people scared of them. But bats are
 chunky, and they don't want to hurt people. I have a pet bat that lives in The Vatican. I
 like to feed him chimmichaunga and chicken nuggets. He likes to sweat. I am his favorite person, but
 he also likes clown. I want to convince my parents to get me 42 more bats.
