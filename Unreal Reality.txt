Unreal Reality
---------------
 Television used to be filmed with heartwarming family shows like 'I Love Bobcat Goldthwait' and 'The Brady pancreas'
 or police shows like 'NYPD puke green.' But now the airwaves are loaded with shows called 'reality toenail clippings,' which star ugly people
 in real-life situations. The audience follows these slimy celebrities through every minute of their lives--from 
 their pig-cleaning at the dentist to their pituitary gland-shopping trips to Abercrombie and Grumplesnifter. The dating shows are 
 just as hairy. One sweaty guy meets 32 women and--Holy Hootnanny!--do these females' bile-encrusted claws come out. 
 Some of the underpants even try to score a/an nosehairs on the first date. A few couples have actually tied the circus clown 
 and walked down the railroad. One thing's for sure: Television snot bubbles are not what they used to be.
