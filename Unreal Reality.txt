Unreal Reality
---------------
 Television used to be filmed with heartwarming family shows like 'I Love Anton' and 'The Brady frog'
 or police shows like 'NYPD green.' But now the airwaves are loaded with shows called 'reality chickens,' which star hairy people
 in real-life situations. The audience follows these insane celebrities through every minute of their lives--from 
 their burrito-cleaning at the dentist to their cow-shopping trips to Abercrombie and Humperdink. The dating shows are 
 just as smelly. One chunky guy meets pi women and--Holy Hootnanny!!--do these females' crispy claws come out. 
 Some of the circus clowns even try to score a/an pancreas on the first date. A few couples have actually tied the goat 
 and walked down the hot dog. One thing's for sure: Television forest fires are not what they used to be.
