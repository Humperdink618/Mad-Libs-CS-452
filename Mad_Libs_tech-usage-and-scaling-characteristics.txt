IntelliJ IDEA: IDE, mainly for development; not present in code structure directly.
Java: Main programming languageâ€”core classes.
Gson (com.google.gson.Gson): Used for JSON serialization/deserialization.
MySQL: RDBMS for persistent storage.
JDBC for MySQL (likely via mysql_connector_java): Allows Java to communicate with the MySQL DB.
Maven: Project management and build tool (dependency management).
Scaling capabilities:

IntelliJ: Not a runtime component, so not scalable in deployment.
Java: Highly scalable (multi-threading, sockets, etc.).
Gson: Scales with memory as it deals with JSON in-memory.
MySQL: Scalable via replication, sharding, clustering.
JDBC: Scales with connection pooling (like via HikariCP).
Maven: Build-only, not a runtime dependency.
